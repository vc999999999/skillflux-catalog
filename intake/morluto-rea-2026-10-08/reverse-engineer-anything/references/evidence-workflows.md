# Evidence, comparison, and verification workflows

REA returns Evidence with each result. Read that result directly, cite its
Evidence ID when another tool or your explanation needs a stable reference, and
preserve authority, limitations, coverage, and residual unknowns. If a result
is incomplete or paginated, continue only when the remaining data matters to
the task; do not fetch a bundle or resource merely to read a result already
returned inline.

Use `record_unknown` to track unresolved questions in the user's investigation
and name the authority or environment still required. Supply supporting and
contradicting evidence IDs. It updates the session registry directly.
Use `update_unknown` with the current revision; reread after a stale revision
instead of retrying blindly. Only qualifying observed evidence can verify a
resolution.

Use comparisons with complete, compatible page sets when claiming equivalence
or absence:

- `compare_artifacts` compares inventory pages by occurrence path, content,
  metadata, and graph relations.
- `compare_functions` compares explicit function Evidence, not fuzzy
  whole-binary matches.
- `compare_bundles` compares canonical bundle membership and unknown history.
- `find_changed_behavior` combines existing comparisons; static differences
  remain candidates, not causal proof.
- `build_call_path` needs explicit function dossiers from one artifact/provider;
  an incomplete frontier makes absence unknown.
- `correlate_static_and_runtime` uses explicit mappings; matching patterns are
  hypotheses, not causality.
- `verify_reconstruction` evaluates a finite typed specification. A pass covers
  only declared comparable claims, not global equivalence.

Process captures are opt-in behavioral evidence, not a security sandbox. V3
captures cannot be upgraded to V4; rerun the original scenario. Distinguish root
exit from descendant settlement and require freshness when the task needs it.
